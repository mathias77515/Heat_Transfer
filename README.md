# Heat_Transfer
This repository try to explain a simple short method to solve the heat equation in one dimension (tow after). We have three different parts which describe :

+ I] Solution of the heat equation in 1 dimensional case
+ II] Solution of the heat equation in 2 dimensional case
+ III] Solution of convection-advection equations (not implemented for now)
